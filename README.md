4.	Project Scope
Musicians often face a serious problem: doing a job of marketing agency and creating and performing great music at the same time. By showcasing their talent, their ultimate goal is to reach millions of fans nationwide. However, fame cannot be achieved overnight, it takes putting time and lots of effort into both producing and promoting the music in order to make it big. 

The ‘Myusync’ website will:

1.	Help musicians succeed and get in touch with their contemporaries for any kind of work, shows, concert using etc.
2.	Provide a platform wherein an artist can build his/her own profile, select his/her own field of expertise (such as guitar, violin, etc) and then search for other musicians to collaborate with.
3.	Provide them job opportunities, which will help them get recognition and succeed in music careers.

The main objective of the website is to intake information given by the musician regarding his/her own personal details, their field of expertise in music (guitar, violin etc) and various other parameters, contact details, their work experience in the musician’s database and to intake the information given by the non-musician i.e., company name, work experience, contact details etc in the non-musician’s database. The musician’s can search for other musician’s for collaboration and the non - musician can search for the musician’s for offering them the job opportunity. The non-profile users can access the musician’s database but contact details won’t be accessible to such types of users. This website has a login system where new musicians and non - musicians will register and the information will be given to the login-credentials database.

This system will benefit the company (non- musician) as well as the job seekers (musicians). Job seekers can post their experiences in their area of expertise. Whereas the non-musicians can offer jobs to the musicians. They can also search for the type of musician they want to hire and can contact them. This system will maintain the database of the musicians as well as the non-musicians.

We aim to make Myusync a recognised and go-to platform for people in the music industry to connect. We expect to expand our reach to huge Music Labels and Publishers. Our goal will always be to help those who have not made it big into the industry and get them recognised by these big companies.
